# Coditor

This was my group's final project for USC's CSCI 201: Principles of Software Engineering. The project functions as a google docs clone, with easy integration for code in many languages such as C++, Python, Java, and more. 

Our motivation for this was that being computer science students, a lot of the notes we take include regular text and code. It becomes cumbersome quickly to switch back and forth from docs and an IDE. 

The solution we came up with was Coditor, a web service which allowed users to switch to "code mode" with a selected language, and see their typed code be automatically formatted according to the chosen language's syntax rules, along with regular text-editor features (bold, italics, font, etc). After signing up for an account, users could share their notes to others and collaborate on the same document with other registered users.
